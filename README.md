# WUSTL Circulator

This is a side project I worked on my junior/senior year of college to track Washington University's Campus Circulator (the bus) around campus. 
 
I'm open sourcing this project in the hope that other entrepreneurial devs from Wash U take an active interest in iOS app development. Apart from that, I don't plan on supporting this application any further, but am always happy to entertain questions and/or provide clarity into my design decisions.

Happy coding :)
